Black devil kneeling:
The **demon now fully dominates the scene**, standing tall and terrifying in the center of the room. Its massive **upper body** is powerful, with every muscle clearly defined and tense. The horns on its head curve menacingly, and its eyes seem to burn with a terrifying intensity. The red glow from the floor creates a dramatic contrast against its dark skin. The ancient stone pillars and walls remain unchanged, emphasizing the consistency of the environment, while the presence of the demon adds a dramatic shift in mood from the earlier godly power to a more sinister force.

The final frame captures the **demon beast in its full glory**, standing menacingly in the same spot where the god once sat. Its massive horns, muscular body, and intense expression fill the room with an overwhelming sense of power and danger. The red glow from the symbol on the floor is now at its brightest, reflecting off the demon’s dark skin. The stone pillars and walls, unchanged since the first frame, remain in place, creating a stark contrast between the powerful creature now in the room and the earlier god-like figure.

Black devil ready to attack:
The **full upper body of the demon** is now visible. Its large, muscular arms are outstretched, and its powerful upper body appears almost too large for the space it occupies. The horns on its head curl upward, making it look even more menacing. Its eyes are bright and intense, and its face is twisted into a snarling, **ferocious expression**. The red glow from the floor symbol reflects off its dark skin, highlighting its features. The room remains visually the same, with the stone pillars and walls framing the imposing figure in the center.

Young god revealed:
The **god’s transformation into his younger self** is now complete. He is standing in the middle of the room, directly over the glowing symbol, having risen from the throne. His face is **youthful and handsome**, with a confident expression. His body, fully revealed, is **muscular and strong**, with every part of him exuding energy. His **blue eyes** appear focused and intense. His armor is gleaming, and the scepter remains firmly in his hand. The stone pillars, walls, and glowing floor symbol remain constant, maintaining the visual theme of the scene.

The image now shows the **young god** beginning to **fade**, still standing on the glowing symbol. His once solid form now seems **translucent**, as though he’s turning into vapor or light. His facial features are still visible, but his body is becoming less defined, as if it’s dissolving into the air. The throne behind him remains empty, and the stone walls and pillars are still present, grounding the scene in the same ancient atmosphere. The glow from the floor is the only change, intensifying slightly under his feet.

The **god has nearly disappeared**. The frame now depicts only faint, indistinct traces of his once powerful figure. The throne room appears empty, except for the remnants of the **faint golden light** where the god stood moments ago. The throne behind him is unoccupied, and the red glow from the floor is now stronger, bathing the entire room in a slightly more intense light. The stone pillars and walls maintain their steady presence, framing the stillness of the scene.
