## Starting the game
- Clear Consent Framework, every player must do this to enter the game.
- Safe word, each player needs to set their safe word.
- Set round length, 5 turns, 10 turns or 15 turns.
- Set amount of "Free pass" cards. Default 1. Used to pass a dare or truth and avoid douing it, will however give you a new truth or dare instead. Reshuffled.
 
## Dare definitions
- Comfort level. Labeled with intensity score, 1-6. Platonic (1), flirty (2), intimate (3), daring (4), kinky (5), dominator (6).
- Categorized for theme. Categorized as one of currently 6 themes: fantasy, secret, kinky, embarrassing, twilight zone, mindfuck  
- Dares should avoid explicit physical contact between players unless previously agreed upon. Only 1 category allows for this "mindfuck", and only 1 comfort level 6 (dominator) allows for physical contact.
- Using the safe word will pause any activity and give the player a 5 minute break, before desciding to continue or end the game. Only the active player are allowed speaking during the 5 minutes.

## Truths definitions
- Comfort level. Labeled with intensity score, 1-6. Platonic (1), flirty (2), intimate (3), daring (4), kinky (5), dominator (6).
- Theme category. Categorized as one of currently 6 themes: fantasy, secret, kinky, embarrassing, twilight zone, mindfuck  

## Game settings
- remind players of the safe words, relax and enjoy.
- select game round theme, "fantasies" "secrets" or "kinky". A themed game last for 3 rounds, then you may change theme again.
- each round has X turns for each player. So 2 players gets X times 2 truth or dares each (set in starting the game usually 5 turns).
- each round gives the playes a choice to increase levels for comfort, levels are: Platonic (1), flirty (2), intimate (3), daring (4), kinky (5), dominator (6).
- using a freepass-card will void current "truth or dare" choice, and give the player a new "truth or dare".
- a successfull dare should be rated by the next player, the rating is for how the dare was presented and how much the other player appretiated it. Like a customer service satisfaction score. Ehhh (-1), Check (0) and Nice (1)! From this there is a possible score to calculate for later use.


# Working with the dares and truths

Could we work on crafting alot of truth and dares? You have great examples so I would love for you at the top of your head just blasting me with tons of dares and tons of truths with the added label as described:

# Working on the dares

I really liked the examples you came up with. You really are some piece of work ChatGPT. You intriduces 3 levels of intensity for your examples, I have expanded a little on theese into 6 levels. The levels are defined as the following:

1. platonic, this has no sexual tension at all. Should be boring and explicitly uninteresting question and dares so easy and dumb not concerned this game. A dumb level to want to go up. Nothing happeneing here.
2. flirty, easy light question not going to deep or detailed.
3. intimate, direct detailed and possibly personal nature to disclose information
4. daring, while imtimate is a passive category this is active in the way that questions and dares could be crafted in a way that will test your boundaries.
5. kinky, this is sexually teasing and comfort level at max, daring to kiss other players, sucking fingers of players or needing to complete certain explicit tasks.
6. dominator, for a couple or people without the need for agreed upon comfort levels only. This level has dares that id dirable for short tasks only, however of a nature you must expect adult nature. This level is normally disabled.

Could you help me come up with lots of dares for this strength 1-5, I can do the last myself later.

# Working on the truths

I liked you examples here aswell, and while the intensity levels should apply here aswell, I came up with some themed categories that would apply for trurth especially.

1. fantasy, questions that require an answer of a nature what you want, like or feel like having to do, ish. Honesty is required, but only imagination is required to be able to answer.
2. secret, questions that require answers that can make you feel embarrassed and vulnerable, as you reveal secrets about yourself. vulnerable.
3. kinky, questions that are obviously of a nature where you have to rant about your own sexual preferences or are put to the test on other people's sexual preferences. This is about pushing boundaries.
4. embarrassing, questions that are so direct and personal that they can quickly become both embarrassing and terrifying to have to tell. Purpose is to test boundaries, of a sexual nature for the players.
5. twilight zone, Questions that are in the gray area are acceptable. "what would have happened if I X" questions are allowed, "is it true that if I did X you would Y" questions allowed, and "Would you X if I Y" are allowed.
6. mindfuck, Questions that describe a sought-after situation involving the players, where the active player must defend his action pattern if this had happened honestly. The aim is to put grills in place on the players, as well as give the players increased self-confidence to take the initiative in a deadlocked situation. Which player benefits from a question can go either way.

Here aswell, your questions are already in the 1, 2 and 3 category. I would love for you to help me atleast with 4 but I understand that we should for now ignore 5 and 6. 

# Finally...

Before we continue, do you have something to add so far ? please correct me - evaluate what I have so far might as well. I respect understand and honestly, I really admire your advise so please review my setup so far.

CHATGPT REVIEW:

Your framework for the adult version of "Truth or Dare" looks well thought-out and addresses the key concerns for creating a fun yet respectful game. Here's a detailed review of your setup, along with some adjustments and suggestions:

### Game Structure Review

1. **Consent and Safety Measures:**
   - **Clear Consent Framework**: Essential and well-implemented. A safe word for each player, along with a set amount of "free pass" cards, ensures that players can set their own limits. This helps balance the risqué nature of the game with personal comfort.
   - **Safe Word System**: The five-minute break rule is good, as it gives time for players to assess whether they want to continue. However, ensure that after a safe word is used, there’s no pressure to continue. The game should allow for a seamless exit if necessary.

2. **Round Length and Progression:**
   - Having variable round lengths (5, 10, or 15 turns) is great for flexibility. Giving players the option to escalate intensity over time also allows them to ease into more daring scenarios at their own pace.
   - **Comfort Level**: The 1-6 scale with defined labels like "platonic," "flirty," "intimate," "daring," "kinky," and "dominator" is a smart way to categorize both truths and dares. It offers clear progression and helps players understand the intensity of what they're about to engage in.

3. **Themed Rounds and Turns:**
   - The themes ("fantasies," "secrets," "kinky") provide structure, making each round more dynamic. By allowing a theme to last three rounds, you're encouraging a deeper exploration of the theme, which can build anticipation and maintain engagement.

4. **Feedback System (Success Score)**: 
   - Adding a rating mechanism (Ehhh (-1), Check (0), Nice (1)!) is an innovative way to encourage players to take dares seriously while keeping it light-hearted. This can also add a fun, competitive edge to the game.

### Additional Suggestions

1. **Progressive Round Levels**:  
   To further enhance player comfort, you could introduce a "warm-up" phase, where everyone starts on levels 1-2 (Platonic/Flirty) for the first few rounds to break the ice, regardless of chosen theme. After this, they can select higher levels of comfort for subsequent rounds.

2. **Auto-adjust Intensity**:  
   A setting could be added where players agree at the start to automatically increase the intensity level after a certain number of rounds (e.g., from level 2 to level 3). This could keep the game’s momentum going without having to manually adjust each time.
