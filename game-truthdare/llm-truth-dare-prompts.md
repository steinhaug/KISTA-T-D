Could you finally help me to craft some instructional prompts I can use for other LLMs to create truths and dares with the same understanding you have done, for all of my levels? So 6 prompts for dares, one for each level / category (Platonic, flirty, intimate, daring, kinky, dominator). And same for truths, 6 prompts here aswell one for each category (Fantasy, secret, kinky, embarrasing, twilight zone, mindfuck).

Here are 6 prompts for generating **dares** and 6 prompts for generating **truths**, one for each of your specified levels/categories. These prompts should work for other LLMs to generate appropriate content for each level or category.

### Dares

#### 1. **Platonic (Level 1)**
*Prompt*: 
"Generate a list of dares that are simple, non-threatening, and purely for fun without any sexual undertones. These dares should be easy to complete, light-hearted, and suitable for creating a fun atmosphere without crossing any personal boundaries. Avoid any physical contact or flirtatiousness. These dares should be suitable for any friendly, playful setting."

#### 2. **Flirty (Level 2)**
*Prompt*:
"Generate a list of dares that are playful, flirty, and create light sexual tension without making anyone uncomfortable. These dares should encourage fun, teasing, and mild flirting, but should not involve any direct sexual actions or explicit behaviors. Keep the tone light-hearted and avoid anything too personal or intimate."

#### 3. **Intimate (Level 3)**
*Prompt*:
"Generate a list of dares that involve intimate actions or conversations, designed to push personal boundaries without causing discomfort. These dares should encourage players to reveal personal preferences, desires, or experiences, without crossing into explicit or overtly sexual territory. Aim for personal and intimate dares that foster connection and openness."

#### 4. **Daring (Level 4)**
*Prompt*:
"Generate a list of dares that push the participants slightly beyond their comfort zone. These dares should involve bolder challenges or tasks that might provoke nervousness or excitement. They can include light physical touch or revealing more personal or sexual details, but should still stay within respectful boundaries. The dares should not force extreme discomfort or explicit sexual contact."

#### 5. **Kinky (Level 5)**
*Prompt*:
"Generate a list of kinky dares that involve a higher level of sexual tension, teasing, and possibly mild physical actions. These dares should encourage players to explore their sexual boundaries in a playful but respectful manner. The tasks may involve light physical contact, role play, or daring behaviors, but should remain consensual and avoid crossing into extreme or uncomfortable situations."

#### 6. **Dominator (Level 6)**
*Prompt*:
"Generate a list of dares that involve dominance and submission themes, intended for players who are comfortable with explicit sexual content and physical interaction. These dares should involve assertive tasks or instructions that reflect power dynamics in a playful way. The dares should be explicit but maintain a consensual and respectful tone. This category is designed for adventurous players."

### Truths

#### 1. **Fantasy (Level 1)**
*Prompt*:
"Generate a list of truths that prompt players to reveal their fantasies, desires, or imaginative scenarios. These questions should explore what players would do, want, or experience in a playful and hypothetical way. The goal is to spark creativity and curiosity without pushing into explicit personal territory."

#### 2. **Secret (Level 2)**
*Prompt*:
"Generate a list of truths that prompt players to reveal secrets or personal information they might not normally share. These questions should focus on uncovering things that are normally kept private, but not to the point of causing discomfort. The goal is to create vulnerability and openness in a respectful way."

#### 3. **Kinky (Level 3)**
*Prompt*:
"Generate a list of kinky truths that prompt players to disclose their sexual preferences, desires, and experiences. These questions should push personal boundaries and involve sharing more explicit information, but still be respectful and consensual. The goal is to explore each player’s comfort zone and stimulate sexual conversation."

#### 4. **Embarrassing (Level 4)**
*Prompt*:
"Generate a list of truths that prompt players to reveal embarrassing, awkward, or uncomfortable moments from their past. These questions should focus on getting players to share stories that make them blush or feel silly, without causing lasting discomfort or harm. The goal is to create lighthearted embarrassment in a playful setting."

#### 5. **Twilight Zone (Level 5)**
*Prompt*:
"Generate a list of truths that fall into the gray area, prompting players to explore hypothetical scenarios or morally ambiguous situations. These questions should make players think about 'what if' situations, choices they might regret, or strange and unusual ideas. The goal is to blur the lines of reality and make the game more thought-provoking and surreal." The scenarios played out in the form of thought experiments must contain one or both participants, and aim to put them in an imagined sexually stimulating or provocative situation and often with unexpected reaction questions. Ex. "If player 1 had given it a proper tongue kiss, would you have liked it?". "If player 1 massaged you on the back, and only that without attempting any tricks. Would you be satisfied?". "If player 1 massaged you on the back and tried some sneaky tricks. What tricks are OK?".

#### 6. **Mindfuck (Level 6)**
*Prompt*:
"Generate a list of truths that challenge the player’s understanding of themselves, their relationships, or the situation they are in. These questions should be designed to confuse, provoke deep thought, or create tension between players by asking uncomfortable or paradoxical questions. The goal is to push players to the limits of their comfort zones and challenge their mental and emotional boundaries."
