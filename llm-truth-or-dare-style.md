1. **Celestial Battle Prompt**
A black screen slowly illuminates with swirling particles of light and dark. On the left, golden particles coalesce into an angelic smiley face with a glowing halo, radiating warmth and truth. On the right, crimson particles form a mischievous devil smiley with gleaming horns. The two faces playfully orbit each other, leaving trails of their respective colors. They settle into position, the angel on the left labeled "TRUTH" in elegant golden script, the devil on the right labeled "DARE" in fiery red letters. The background subtly pulses with a gentle glow, alternating between warm gold and deep red hues. The faces animate subtly - the angel occasionally winking knowingly, while the devil smirks and raises its eyebrows enticingly.

2. **Ink and Water Prompt**
Starting with a black screen, drops of white and red ink fall from above, spreading and swirling in water-like patterns. The white ink forms a clean, pure side on the left, while the red ink creates a bold, dynamic side on the right. From the white ink emerges a simplified angel smiley face, its halo formed by rippling white ink. From the red side, a devil smiley materializes, its horns drawn by swirling red tendrils. The word "TRUTH" appears in clean, minimalist font on the angel side, while "DARE" emerges in bold, edgy letters on the devil side. The inks continue to move subtly, creating a hypnotic, fluid animation that never fully settles.

3. **Digital Glitch Prompt**
From complete darkness, green digital code begins to rain down Matrix-style. The code splits into two columns - one blue, one red. Glitch effects and digital artifacts start forming two distinct shapes. The blue code consolidates into a pixel art angel smiley face, with occasional glitch effects making its halo flicker. The red code forms a devil smiley face, its horns occasionally breaking apart into pixels before reforming. The words "TRUTH" and "DARE" glitch into existence beneath their respective faces. The entire scene has a subtle CRT screen effect, with scan lines and digital noise adding to the technological aesthetic.

4. **Paper Art Prompt**
A black paper background dramatically tears down the middle, revealing two distinct worlds. On the left, white paper folds and creases origami-style to form a serene, geometric angel smiley face, its halo a perfect golden circle. On the right, red paper crafts a sharp, angular devil smiley, with pointed horns and a playful smirk. The word "TRUTH" unfolds in clean paper cuts on the left, while "DARE" burns into existence on the right. Paper elements continue to make micro-movements, creating an ever-shifting, tactile appearance. The torn black background occasionally shows glimpses of golden light on the left and flickering embers on the right.

5. **Neon Signs Prompt**
In darkness, electric sparks begin to crackle and form two distinct neon sign outlines. On the left, blue-white electricity forms a gentle angel smiley face, its halo buzzing with a soft, steady glow. On the right, red lightning creates a daring devil smiley, horns crackling with electric energy. The word "TRUTH" flickers to life in steady, blue-white neon beneath the angel, while "DARE" blazes in passionate red neon under the devil. Both signs occasionally flicker and buzz with authentic neon sign effects, casting their respective colored glows onto an imagined wall behind them. Small electric arcs occasionally jump between the two signs, creating a dynamic, energized atmosphere.

**Prompt 1:**  
"A black screen fades in, revealing a calm blue sky with soft clouds rolling in. As the clouds drift, two orbs of light appear—one golden on the left and one red on the right. The golden orb transforms into a glowing smiley face with a halo (angel), while the red orb morphs into a devil smiley face with red horns. The background gradually darkens, splitting the screen in half, with the left side illuminated by soft golden light for Truth, and the right side lit by fiery red light for Dare. The final frame displays both icons hovering, pulsing gently, inviting a choice."

**Prompt 2:**  
"Starting from complete darkness, a small glowing line draws itself horizontally across the screen, creating a split between the left and right halves. On the left, soft golden light begins to emerge, slowly shaping into a glowing halo. The right half glows with fiery red light, forming a devilish smiley face with sharp horns. The screen transitions into a full split view, with the Truth side bathed in calm golden hues and the Dare side glowing with intense red. Both icons are centered, waiting for the player to make a choice, as the background settles into its contrasting tones."

**Prompt 3:**  
"The video begins with a black screen, and a soft mist begins to swirl from the center. From the left side, a halo gently descends from above, landing on a smiley face, while on the right side, red horns rise from below, attaching to a mischievous smiley face. The mist gradually clears, leaving a clear split-screen. The Truth side glows with a peaceful golden light, while the Dare side pulses with a dangerous red hue. As the mist fades completely, both icons settle into place, pulsing subtly, waiting for the player's selection."

**Prompt 4:**  
"A dark screen transitions with a quick flash of light, dividing the screen in two. On the left, golden sparkles begin to form a glowing smiley face with a halo, while on the right, fiery embers ignite into a devil smiley face with red horns. As both images become clearer, the screen solidifies into two halves: the Truth side radiating soft, heavenly light, and the Dare side flickering with fiery red embers. The final frame shows both smiley faces centered on their respective sides, inviting a choice, with subtle glowing effects on each icon."

**Prompt 5:**  
"The video opens to a black screen with a single pulse of light from the center. The light splits into two directions, left and right. On the left side, the light forms into a glowing halo above a smiley face, symbolizing Truth. On the right, the light shifts into a fiery red, forming devil horns on a mischievous smiley face, symbolizing Dare. The screen fully divides into a clear split view with contrasting colors—golden light on the left and fiery red on the right. Both smiley faces pulse gently, floating in the center of their respective halves, as the video reaches the final frame."

Prompt 1: Angel and Devil Transition
Start with a completely black screen. Slowly, a glowing golden light fades in on the left, taking the shape of a smiley face with a halo, symbolizing "Truth." On the right, a red light begins to glow, forming a devilish smiley face with horns for "Dare." Both icons remain stationary at first, and then they start pulsating in sync, increasing in brightness as they approach the middle of the screen. Around the 3-second mark, the screen splits vertically, with a bright golden light on the left for "Truth" and fiery red on the right for "Dare." The split happens smoothly, and the two options remain side by side for player selection by the end of the 5-second clip.

Prompt 2: Soft Waves and Flames Transition
The screen starts as a blank, dark space. Gentle waves of white light begin to move from the left side, growing larger and forming the outline of an angelic figure with a halo that represents "Truth." At the same time, red flames flicker on the right, gradually forming the devil smiley with horns for "Dare." The screen remains fluid with the waves and flames moving until a sharp line cuts the screen vertically down the center at 3 seconds. The background behind "Truth" becomes a soft, flowing blue, while behind "Dare," the flames turn into a fiery red hue. The clip ends with both options clearly visible in a dynamic split screen.

Prompt 3: Starburst and Sparks Reveal
A black screen quickly flickers with distant stars or sparks. From the left, a radiant starburst effect appears, slowly expanding into a bright yellow light, revealing a smiling face with a halo, symbolizing "Truth." Simultaneously on the right, sparks fly as a red, devilish face with horns begins to emerge. As the two entities glow brighter, a clear line splits them down the middle at 3.5 seconds, creating a neat division between the left side with the angelic smiley and the right side with the devilish smiley. By 5 seconds, the background behind "Truth" glows softly, while behind "Dare," the sparks intensify, ready for player interaction.

Prompt 4: Floating Clouds and Rising Smoke
Begin with a blank black screen. Slowly, white, puffy clouds start drifting in from the left side of the screen, revealing a serene smiley face with a halo above it, representing "Truth." On the right, dark smoke begins to rise, gradually unveiling a devilish grin with red horns representing "Dare." The smoke swirls ominously while the clouds float peacefully, creating an interesting contrast between the two. At the 3-second mark, a clear split forms in the middle, and the screen becomes divided, with a soft blue hue behind "Truth" and dark, smoky red behind "Dare." The split remains until the end of the clip.

Prompt 5: Light and Shadow Collision
The screen starts black and silent. From the left side, a soft, warm light begins to spread, growing into the shape of a smiling face with a halo, symbolizing "Truth." From the right, a shadowy figure with red horns and a devilish grin representing "Dare" pushes through the darkness. Both icons begin to expand slowly, approaching the center of the screen. At the 3-second mark, the two forces meet but do not mix, creating a sharp, vertical split down the middle. By 5 seconds, the screen is fully split between the glowing, soft light on the left (Truth) and the dark, shadowy aura on the right (Dare), with both clearly visible for selection.
