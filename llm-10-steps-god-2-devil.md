Here’s a **10-second transition sequence** with detailed descriptions of the surroundings and each stage of transformation, from the **old Zeus-like god** to the **younger self**, to the **vanishing**, and finally into the **demon beast** materializing. The focus will be on keeping the room and atmosphere consistent throughout the transformation for better visual continuity.

### **Scene Overview**:  
The setting is an ancient, mystical throne room carved out of black stone. The air is thick with energy, and a faint red glow illuminates the massive stone pillars lining the sides. In the center of the room is a raised stone platform with a glowing red symbol etched into the floor, radiating an eerie light. The air hums with magic, and faint embers float through the room as if something powerful is about to happen. Dark, intricate patterns crawl up the walls, faintly pulsing with energy. 

---

### **Frame 1 (0-1 second)**:  
We begin with an **old, powerful god** resembling Zeus, sitting tall and imposing on the throne in the center of the room. His **blonde hair** is wild, long, and streaked with white, and his thick beard reaches down to his muscular upper body. His **glowing blue eyes** scan the room, and his **bronzed skin** radiates divine power. His large hands grip a massive, glowing scepter, and his upper body is adorned with gold armor, gleaming against the backdrop of the dark throne room. Red embers float lazily through the air, and the black stone walls behind him reflect the faint red glow from the floor.

---

### **Frame 2 (1-3 seconds)**:  
As the **god begins to transform**, his **facial features soften** slightly, wrinkles around his eyes and mouth fading. His hair begins to shift in color, turning a bright **golden blonde**, and his beard shortens, becoming neater and more refined. The scepter in his hand glows brighter as if absorbing energy from the surroundings, casting light across his body, which now appears **more youthful and vigorous**. The red light from the glowing symbol on the floor intensifies, casting long shadows along the black stone walls, which flicker with the swirling embers.

---

### **Frame 3 (3-4 seconds)**:  
Now, the **god stands** from his throne, completely transformed into his **younger self**. His body is muscular and chiseled, every movement exuding strength and grace. His hair is now a brilliant **gold**, flowing down his back, and his piercing **blue eyes** glow with the intensity of youthful divinity. His armor seems to tighten around his torso, revealing the powerful physique beneath. The red embers in the air swirl faster now, reacting to the god’s transformation as the stone walls pulse in sync with the glowing floor symbol.

---

### **Frame 4 (4-5 seconds)**:  
At this moment, the **younger god smiles confidently** as his entire body begins to shimmer. The **golden aura** surrounding him flickers like a dying flame, and his **form starts to blur**. Slowly, his body begins to dissipate, as if turning to pure light. His muscles fade, and his once powerful figure starts to dissolve into the air, fragmenting into faint golden sparks. The room darkens slightly as the god fades, but the red glow from the symbol on the floor remains steady, growing ominously brighter.

---

### **Frame 5 (5-6 seconds)**:  
Now, the god is almost entirely gone, reduced to a swirling cloud of faint golden light. The embers in the air flicker violently, spinning faster and more erratically. The throne room feels **tense**, as though it’s bracing for something dark to come. The red light from the floor symbol intensifies, casting a crimson hue on the walls, while the throne sits empty, waiting. A faint growl can be heard in the distance, echoing ominously through the chamber as the atmosphere becomes heavy with anticipation.

---

### **Frame 6 (6-7 seconds)**:  
Suddenly, a **deep, guttural rumbling** fills the room, shaking the stone pillars. The golden light that had once been the god vanishes completely, leaving only the flickering embers and the red glow. The air becomes cold, and the once divine energy is replaced with something much darker. Shadows begin to writhe on the stone walls, stretching and growing longer, creeping toward the center of the room where the god once stood. The faint growl grows louder, and the ground trembles as the room prepares for the **arrival of something monstrous**.

---

### **Frame 7 (7-8 seconds)**:  
From the center of the glowing red symbol, **massive black claws** emerge, gripping the stone floor with terrifying strength. The claws are attached to **huge, muscular arms**, their skin dark and leathery, covered in deep scars and cracks that faintly glow with a sinister light. As the creature pulls itself up from the symbol, its massive horns come into view—twisting, jagged, and glowing with infernal energy. The camera pans up to reveal the **beast’s powerful, muscular upper body**, covered in dark fur and patches of charred skin. The demon beast growls as it materializes, its yellow eyes burning with primal rage.

---

### **Frame 8 (8-9 seconds)**:  
The demon’s **full form** is now visible in the center of the room. Its **upper body is broad** and heaving, muscles bulging as it stands upright. The demon’s massive, hulking arms flex as it roars, shaking the entire room. Its head is crowned by enormous **twisted horns**, each one glowing with a faint red light that pulses in sync with the glowing floor symbol. Its body radiates raw, destructive power, and its skin appears cracked and molten in places, with faint trails of smoke rising from its muscles. The embers swirling through the air are now erratic, as if responding to the dark energy radiating from the beast.

---

### **Frame 9 (9-10 seconds)**:  
As the demon beast lets out a **final, earth-shaking roar**, its body fully materializes. Its muscular arms and upper body glow faintly with an infernal light, the heat radiating from its skin warping the air around it. Its eyes lock onto the camera, glowing with **pure malice**. The embers in the air dance wildly, swirling around the demon as it stands tall and menacing, filling the entire frame. The red glow from the floor intensifies, casting the room in a hellish light as the once divine energy of the god is completely replaced by the terrifying presence of the demon.

---

### **Final Frame (10 seconds)**:  
The demon beast, now fully materialized, stands **tall and powerful** in the center of the room, its muscular body exuding dark energy. The red glow from the floor pulses in rhythm with its heavy breathing, and the embers continue to swirl wildly around it. The stone pillars behind the beast appear cracked and scorched, as if its mere presence is causing the room to decay. The demon’s massive horns curve menacingly above its head, and its glowing yellow eyes burn with pure rage as it lets out one final, menacing growl.

---

In this sequence, the **room remains consistent** throughout, while the god’s transformation into a demon beast adds tension and power. The **ancient throne room** setting, with its red glow and swirling embers, provides a mystical, otherworldly atmosphere, keeping the scene dynamic and engaging.
